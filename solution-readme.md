# Part 1
### Question 1
3. 80%.  
There is 10 lines of code, excluding the two lines I was told to disregard. With the given input for left and right, the only two lines of code that are never reached are "rn = 0" (because rn !> 21), and "return ln" (because ln !> rn). This means 8/10 lines are reached meaning 80% coverage.
### Question 2
4. None of the other answers is true.  
None of them really described the relationship between the two, which I'd say is that specification tests code based on rules to see if the work properly, whereas structural tests are on branch paths and seeing which lines get covered.
# Part 2
https://github.com/kcerva14/SE333Assignment1/blob/main/src/test/java/org/example/NumberUtilsTest.java

I required 5 extra tests for full coverage. I marked on the file where I started my contribution for this assignemnt with the " //ASSIGNMENT 2".
# Part 3 & Part 4
https://github.com/kcerva14/structural-based-testing-kcerva14/blob/main/LeftPadUtilsTest.java

100% coverage for this part was reached only after I ran the code with it checking for coverage as I was off by one test.
